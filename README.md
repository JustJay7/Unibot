# UniBot – AI-Powered Academic Chatbot for Bennett University

UniBot is an intelligent, NLP-powered chatbot designed to help students and faculty access academic information like professor cabin locations, specializations, and real-time class schedules using natural, conversational language. Built with Python and Flask, UniBot integrates multiple machine learning and web scraping techniques to provide contextual, real-time responses - all while being fully containerized for scalable deployment.

---

## Features

- **Locate Professor Cabins** via simple chat queries  
- **Intent Classification** using a custom-trained ANN model  
- **Fetch Professor Specializations** via Proxycurl and SerpAPI  
- **Timetable Queries** including next class, free time, etc.  
- **Follow-Up Questions** with session-based memory  
- **Secure Authentication** for login and role-based access  
- **Professor-only Interfaces** to update cabins and timetables  
- **Dockerized Deployment** for environment consistency  
- **Real-time scraping**, NLP, TF-IDF, Regex, and Coreference resolution

---

## Tech Stack

### Backend:
- Python 3.7
- Flask Microframework
- SQLite (File-based database)

### Machine Learning & NLP:
- Keras (Sequential ANN for intent classification)
- TF-IDF for specialization queries
- SpaCy, NLTK for text preprocessing
- AllenNLP (coref-spanBERT-large for coreference resolution)
- Regex + GPT (fallback logic for name/entity extraction)
- Mistral/OpenAI (for final response polishing)

### APIs:
- Proxycurl API (LinkedIn scraping for professor background)
- SerpAPI (Google search for LinkedIn URL fallback)
- PhantomBuster (for deeper profile data)

### Deployment:
- Docker (complete containerization)
- Render (public deployment platform)
- GitHub (source code hosting)
